Initial Base Requirements:

* Replace [jupyterhub.fhcrc.org](https://jupyterhub.fhcrc.org) with a solution that includes Jupyter Notebook
* Replace [rstudio.fhcrc.org](https://rstudio.fhcrc.org) with a solution that includes Rstudio
* Provide github integration for both notebooks (Rstudio has this already, Jupyterhub does not)
* Integrate our EasyBuild environment modules as selectable kernels for both notebooks
* Ideally, combine the above products into a single sign-on location
* Ideally, host the solution in the cloud
